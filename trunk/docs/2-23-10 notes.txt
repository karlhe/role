notes from office hours:

document needs to only include stuff that will be implemented for
iteration 1 (clearly mention what and how things are going to be
implemented)


acceptance test/user test need to be more specific so that other teams can
implement them


class diagrams need to include all Java classes and activities (for this
iteration) -- other teams should be able to understand and implement
everything from them
